## Step 2: Data Loading and Inspection

Load your bulk RNA-seq count matrix and sample metadata:

```bash
🦞 You: "Load the bulk RNA-seq count matrix from counts.csv and sample metadata from metadata.csv. The data has treatment vs control samples with batch effects."
```

**Expected Output:**

## Step 4: Experimental Design and Formula Construction

Create the design matrix using R-style formulas:

```bash
🦞 You: "Create a design matrix using the formula ~condition + batch + time_point + condition:time_point to model treatment effects, batch effects, and time-dependent responses"
```

## Step 10: Advanced Analysis Options

### Gene Set Analysis with Custom Gene Lists

🦞 You: "Perform gene set enrichment analysis using custom gene sets from literature - analyze if our treatment signature overlaps with known drug response signatures"
```

### Temporal Analysis

```bash
🦞 You: "Create temporal expression profiles showing how gene expression changes over time for both treatment and control conditions"
```

### Batch Effect Correction

```bash
🦞 You: "Apply ComBat batch correction and re-run the differential expression analysis to compare results with and without batch correction"
```

### Integration with External Databases

```bash
🦞 You: "Query the Connectivity Map (CMap) database to identify potential drug compounds that could reverse our treatment signature"
```

## Working with Complex Designs

### Multi-Factor Experiments

For experiments with multiple factors (e.g., treatment, time, cell type):

```bash
🦞 You: "Design a three-way interaction model: ~treatment * time * celltype with proper contrast specification"
```

### Paired Sample Analysis

For paired/matched sample designs:

```bash
🦞 You: "Analyze paired samples using the formula ~patient + condition to account for patient-specific effects"
```

### Time Series Analysis

For temporal experiments with multiple time points:

```bash
🦞 You: "Model time as a continuous variable and identify genes with linear, quadratic, or cubic temporal patterns"
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Low Count Genes
```bash
🦞 You: "Many genes have very low counts - should I filter them?"
```
**Solution**: Filter genes with < 1 CPM in < 3 samples (or minimum group size).

### Issue 2: Batch Effects Too Strong
```bash
🦞 You: "Batch effects are overwhelming the biological signal"
```
**Solution**: Use RUVSeq or sva for batch correction, or include batch as blocking factor.

### Issue 3: No Significant Genes
```bash
🦞 You: "My analysis found no significantly DE genes"
```
**Solution**: Check sample sizes, effect sizes, and consider less stringent FDR thresholds.

### Issue 4: Design Matrix Issues
```bash
🦞 You: "Getting 'matrix not full rank' error"
```
**Solution**: Check for confounded factors or redundant terms in the design.

## Best Practices

1. **Sample Size**: Minimum n=3 per group, preferably n≥6 for robust results
2. **Quality Control**: Always inspect data before analysis
3. **Multiple Testing**: Use FDR correction for genome-wide testing
4. **Effect Size**: Report fold changes with statistical significance
5. **Validation**: Validate key findings with qRT-PCR or independent datasets
6. **Documentation**: Keep detailed records of analysis parameters

## Integration with Other Analyses

### Convert to Single-Cell Format
```bash
🦞 You: "Simulate single-cell data from bulk RNA-seq for method comparison"
