## ‚ú® What is Lobster AI?

Lobster AI is a bioinformatics platform that combines specialized AI agents with open-source tools to analyze complex multi-omics data (starting with transcriptomics). Simply describe your analysis needs in natural language - no coding required.

**Perfect for:**
- Bioinformatics researchers analyzing RNA-seq data
- Computational biologists seeking intelligent analysis workflows
- Life science teams requiring reproducible, publication-ready results
- Students learning modern bioinformatics approaches

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- An LLM API key (Claude or AWS Bedrock)

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/the-omics-os/lobster-local.git
cd lobster-local

# 2. Install with make (handles all dependencies)
make install 
#and if you want to access lobster from other directories later you can add:
make install-global

# 3. Set up your API key
cp .env.example .env
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-your-key-here" >> .env

# 4. Start analyzing!
lobster chat
# or if you want to see the reasoning
lobster chat --reasoning 
```

## üí° Example Usage

### Interactive Chat Mode

```bash
ü¶û lobster chat

Welcome to Lobster AI - Your bioinformatics analysis assistant

ü¶û You: Download GSE109564 and perform single-cell clustering analysis

ü¶û Lobster: I'll download and analyze this single-cell dataset for you...

‚úì Downloaded 5,000 cells √ó 20,000 genes
‚úì Quality control: filtered to 4,477 high-quality cells
‚úì Identified 12 distinct cell clusters
‚úì Generated UMAP visualization and marker gene analysis

Analysis complete! Results saved to workspace.
```

### Available Commands

| Command | Description |

## üîß Configuration

### API Keys

Lobster AI requires an LLM provider (fill these lines in the newly created `.env` file). Choose one:

**Option 1: Claude API (Recommended)**
No cost output yet, be aware! You can always switch to cost efficient mode
```bash
# Get your key from https://console.anthropic.com/
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-your-key-here
```

**Option 2: AWS Bedrock**
```bash
# Requires AWS account with Bedrock access
AWS_BEDROCK_ACCESS_KEY=AKIA...
AWS_BEDROCK_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
```

### Optional Configuration

```bash
# Enhanced literature search
NCBI_API_KEY=your-ncbi-api-key  # Get from NCBI

# Force specific provider (auto-detected by default)
LOBSTER_LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic  # or "bedrock"
```
